# Covid
"No JOINS were hurt in the completion of this project"


Working with the Covid Dataset to gain Insights
This is a SQL projected guided by Alex_Freberg. In order to make this project feel like home I made a major adjustments.

1. Dataset: The original dataset used by Alex_Freberg is is split into death metrics and vaccination metrics. Instead I used the most updated version of this dataset as of October 2022. which is why I say no Joins were hurt in the completion of this project.


## A few things that shocked me while doing this projectã€‚
1. At the peak of Covid in Canada the probability of dying after getting covid was roughly 9%. For all the disruptive changes that were being made by the government, and the ways it was cvered in the news I was expecting to see a 20% death rate at least. This is why data is important.

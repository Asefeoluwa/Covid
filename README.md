# Covid-SQL PROJECT
"No JOINS were hurt in the completion of this project"


Working with the Covid Dataset to gain Insights
This is a SQL projected guided by Alex_Freberg. In order to make this project feel like home I made a minor adjustment.

1. Dataset: The original dataset used by Alex_Freberg is split into two datasets death metrics and vaccination metrics. Instead this project uses the most recent version of the dataset resulting one only one dataset. Hence no JOINS were hurt in the completion of this project. I have a feww other projects that use inner Joins and Left Joins e.t.c


## A few things that shocked me while doing this projectã€‚
1. At the peak of Covid in Canada the probability of dying after getting covid was roughly 9%.
